Exercise 01:
Changing Variable Values in a Struct

------------------------------------------------------------------

1)
In this directory, create again a header file called "struct.h".
In "struct.h" create a struct called "s_store".
As you are creating the struct, type-define it as "t_store".
Your struct will have three variables this time:
- an int called "reg_price"
- an int called "sale_price"
- and a string pointer called "goods".

2)
Also in this directory, create a file named "struct.c".
In "struct.c" you will create a function:
- The function will capitalize the first byte of the
variable "goods" contained within a struct named "item" (our
calling function will guarantee that the first char in the 
string is between 'a' and 'z').
- The function will also set "sale_price" of "item" to a value
equal to ("reg_price" - 1).
- "reg_price" in "item" must not change.
- Your function must be prototyped as follows:

void	set_sale_item(t_store	*item);

Run test01.sh
If it does not compile or if the values in the sturct are not
properly manipulated, your struct was not properly defined
according to the guidelines.
If it is a success, you will know.

Good luck!

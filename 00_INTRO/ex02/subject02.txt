Exercise 02:
The Arena

------------------------------------------------------------------

In this exercise, we will be creating RPG characters to take down
a champion. You will create the struct that holds each
character's attributes and our program will send them forth until
one of them is strong enough to slay the dragon.

1)
In this directory, create once more a header file called
"heroes.h".
In "heroes.h" create a struct called "s_hero".
As you are creating the struct, type-define it as "t_hero".
Your struct must have the following variables:
- a string pointer called "name".
- an int called "hp".
- an int called "attack".
- an int called "speed".
- a char called "alive".

Note: we use the char as a BOOLEAN variable to determine whether 
an hero is still alive.

2)
Also in this directory, create a file named "arena.c".
In "arena.c" you will create a function prototyped as follows:

void	battle(t_hero *champion, t_hero	*challenger);

- Initalize two t_hero pointers: *p1 and *p2.
- Point p1 to either the Challenger or the Champion, depending
on whichever has the greater "speed" attribute. p2 points to the
other hero.
- p1 attacks first, which means that you must decrement "hp" of
p2 by the "attack" value of p1.
- p2 attacks second, so decrement the "hp" of p1 accordingly.
- A hero is killed when their "hp" <= 0
- RULE: p2 does not get to attack if this hero has "hp" <= 0.
- When a hero is killed, you must set its "alive" char to 0.

Our program will run a series of Champions and Challengers to
see who will be the final victor in our gladiator arena.

Run test02.sh
If it does not compile or if the values in the sturct are not
properly manipulated, your struct was not properly defined
according to the guidelines.
If it is a success, you will know.

Good luck!
